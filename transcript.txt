2025 is almost here and let me tell you things are moving faster than ever the world is changing and if you don't keep up you might get left behind jobs are evolving Industries are transforming and even the way you work is completely shifting but don't worry I've got you covered in this one single video I'm going to talk about five high income skills that can not only help you survive 2025 but also thrive in it and no I'm not talking about some random things over here these are the same skills that have helped me build businesses earn a stable income and stay ahead of the game but here's the thing you need to watch this video till the very end why because these skills are not just about earning money they are about future proofing yourself and I'll be sharing insights and tips that you won't find anywhere else on YouTube so stick around till the end and I promise you it will be all worth it this video was made possible after watching over 100 plus videos of Alex horoi Chris Williamson and every single thing is then joted down in this one video these are the same skills that have been repeated over and over again with all of the successful business people that we see right now so what are the skills that I'm talking about the first skill is digital marketing this skill is literally the backbone of every single business out there today I mean just think about it every business whether it's a small cafe or a billion ion dollar company everyone needs to Market itself online platforms like Instagram YouTube and Google are the new Battlegrounds for attention businesses are willing to spend a lot of money to reach their target audience and that's where digital marketers come in now why am I telling you all of this well I run my own digital marketing agency where we help Brands grow online I've been running an agency where I've seen massive growth with the demand of digital marketers over here and it's not just in one sector I've seen e-commerce businesses web3 companies every single one requires digital marketing right now for all of these companies I've personally run ad campaigns that have generated amazing results for them to be honest if you look at it a successful campaign is basically just a cash cow the more amount of money that you put in in that campaign the more return you'll get just so you understand what I'm talking about I was running an ad campaign for this particular e-commerce brand they used to sell shoes now they had their own shop and they were doing well offline but they wanted to go online as well that's where I suggested running some ads for their website and building their e-commerce brand online the ads that we were running on meta were getting a roas of over 3x what it means is if we put 1,000 rup for that ad campaign we were getting sales worth of 3,000 rupes which is 3x increase in the sales so basically the more amount of money we were pumping into that campaign the more we were getting out of it it's an endless loop of making more and more money and getting new customers one thing you have to realize over here is that once you find a winning product you need to make as many ad campaigns as you can for that now I don't want to get into the details of digital marketing over here but if you want a separate video just talking about digital marketing then let me know in the comments down below I love to make a separate video just for digital marketing there but in order to run these ads you literally don't even need a degree to learn all of these things it's completely free available on YouTube available elsewhere and you can learn digital marketing right now if you learn this skill you can literally pitch any business take them from offline to online and start selling their products and services online directly this was well understood by Gary V you might recognize this particular person he is Gary ve he built his dad's wine business from a $3 million company to $60 million Empire and this was all possible due to digital marketing now digital marketing does not mean that you just run ads there are different ways in which you do digital marketing if you look at gar he mainly uses platforms like YouTube Twitter Instagram and all of these things to organically grow his content and through that content he gets a lot of clients for example the video that I'm making right now I might probably get a lot of clients for digital marketing from this video itself but if you're just starting out what are the tools that you need to learn first learn meta ads manager or Google ads as well and then also learn analytics tools like meta pixel and Google analytics this forms the basic of Performance Marketing which is running these ads and one more tip is focus on creating content that connects emotionally with your audience just like right now I'm doing that later in this video I'll share a secret tool I use to make my ad campaigns 10x more effective so don't miss out on that but let's move over to the second skill which is blockchain and web3 now I know this may sound a bit technical but hear me out blockchain is not just about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies I've made a separate video just detailing about the basics of crypto and blockchain so if you haven't watched it go check it out but this technology is already transforming Industries like Finance Healthcare and even gaming right now blockchain basically offers what traditional systems can't offer which is security transparency and decentralization I know these terms sound complex to you but trust me it's really important that you start getting into blockchain or at least know the basics of it this space is still in its early stage which means there's a huge demand for people who understand how it works just a year back I started metais Technologies which is my own tech company where we work on different blockchain projects the reason I'm mentioning this over here is because the rise of blockchain projects that we are getting is insane we first only used to work with mobile app development or web development projects but now blockchain projects are just on another level one of the projects that we recently worked on was an nft based platform now there are several platforms that we are building several decentralized applications that we are building and businesses are literally scrambling to find blockchain developers to find blockchain consultants and so on if you learn this skill monetizing it would be a piece of cake now this does not mean that you stick to just one blockchain many developers do this mistake they stick to just ethereum or Solana and they don't learn either or you should actually be open to learning all the programming languages that are out there especially solidity and rust but if you're not a coder don't worry just understanding how blockchain Works how cryptocurrency works it can open up so many opportunities in Consulting in marketing and so on and so forth I've made a detail video on how to start freelancing in web 3 so if you want to go check it out you can basically press the I button over here but if you want mean to create an entire video again on this topic then let me know in the comments below because there are a lot of things that have changed but this was specifically for people who are interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency let's talk about the third skill which is something that every single person consumes in fact you are being a customer right now for that skill and that skill is content creation every single platform today from YouTube to Instagram to even Tik Tok is looking for creators if you're from a country that does not have Tik Tok at all then trust me use vpns use whatever you can but look look into Tik Tok the kind of content that is going out there it's insane back in the days when content creation was just a cringe activity which was only for fun is gone now content creation is a serious career path and people are earning millions of dollars through it take my YouTube channel for example I've built a community of over 75,000 subscribers now and it's not just about the numbers this channel helps me earn through a bunch of different ways first is of course ads that you watch the second is brand new deals we also have courses and products that we sell of our own almost all of our clients come from organic content through YouTube through Instagram and so on and so forth so creating content now is just not a skill it's an investment in yourself and there are a lot of businesses that have still not gotten onto social media that are looking for creators and whoever says that this particular Niche or this particular category is already filled with content creators then let me just tell you that content creators demand is increasing day by day right now every single business is leveraging social media in one way or another there are creators who are building Brands through YouTube and Instagram's content if you look at Mr Beast who is currently the world's most subscribed YouTuber he started with simple Challenge videos and now he's the biggest YouTuber in the world and why is that it's because he creates content that people just can't stop watching if you're just starting out use your phone focus on storytelling and don't overthink the production quality or whatever what matters is the consistency and connecting with your audience if you want to learn more about how I create these videos how I script my videos and so on and so forth I've made a detailed video for this as well just go check it out but the second last skill that I want to talk about over here is sales and negotiation and the last skill please wait for it it's one of the most important one so what do I mean by sales and negotiation because it's considered as a soft skill whether you are selling a product service or even an idea knowing how to sell is a skill that can make you probably Unstoppable it doesn't matter if you're in business freelancing or even working a job if you can sell you can succeed are you born with this skill absolutely not some people already have a knack for selling but here's what you need to do in order to learn that skill if you don't already know it when I started pitching brands for collaborations I had no idea what I was doing but over time I learned how to present my value handle objections and close deals today we have people who are specifically focused in on sales for all of our clients this is basically a skill that if you pair up with digital marketing makes you Unstoppable you can generate leads through digital marketing running ads and so on and so forth and then close those leads by using your sales and negotiation techniques and that is exactly what I do with all of my agencies one small thing that I want to mention over over here is start listening rather than saying while selling your products and services it's very important that you understand what is the need of the customer or the client in front of you if they give you that need that is something that you can pick up on and then provide a solution for and then charge whatever you want and drum roll we are on the last skill the last skill is AI and Automation and I know you have heard this millions of times through every every single person out there you should learn AI you should learn about automations but here is something that I want to tell you which is going to be different now you might already be familiar with AI tools like Char gbd but what you might not be familiar with is automation tools AI tools if paired up with good automation tools like zapier ift if you know how to use these tools and automate boring tasks then you can probably just work at light speed for for example I have an automation running with zapo which I use in order to convert the entire YouTube videos that I upload to a Blog and then publish it over there this is completely automated and whenever I just upload a video it goes out as a Blog as well I had made a video on automation tools over years back and if you still haven't watched that video please go watch it because I am telling you right now ai tools paired up with automation tools are the future the these five skills digital marketing blockchain content creation sales and AI these are not just skills they are your ticket to staying ahead in 2025 and Beyond but here's the catch you have to start now so this is what we'll do we'll pick one skill commit to learning it and take consistent action behind it if you are with me then just commend the skill that you are going to take for the next one year and learn it and start being consistent
